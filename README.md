# üì¶ react-daily-calorie-intake

A lightweight **TypeScript/React library** to calculate **daily calorie needs and macronutrient splits** (protein, carbs, fats) using the **Mifflin-St Jeor formula** and activity multipliers.  

It helps you quickly estimate:  
- **BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate)** ‚Üí calories your body needs at rest  
- **Maintenance calories** ‚Üí calories needed to maintain current weight  
- **Adjusted calories** ‚Üí based on fitness goal (lose, maintain, gain)  
- **Macronutrient split** ‚Üí protein, carbs, fats in grams  

Perfect for fitness apps, diet planners, or any React project that needs calorie and nutrition tracking.

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
npm install react-daily-calorie-intake
```
or

```
yarn add react-daily-calorie-intake
```
## üõ† Usage in React
```
import React from "react";
import { calculateCalories } from "react-daily-calorie-intake";

export default function App() {
  const result = calculateCalories({
    gender: "male",
    weight_lbs: 170,     // weight in pounds
    ageYears: 25,        // age in years
    heightInches: 70,    // height in inches (5'10")
    goals: -1,           // lose 1 lb per week (-1), maintain (0), gain 1 lb per week (+1)
    activityLevel: "moderate", // sedentary, light, moderate, active, very_active
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Daily Nutrition Recommendation</h2>
      <p><strong>BMR:</strong> {result.bmr.toFixed(0)} kcal</p>
      <p><strong>Maintenance Calories:</strong> {result.maintenance.toFixed(0)} kcal</p>
      <p><strong>Target Calories:</strong> {result.adjustedCalories.toFixed(0)} kcal</p>
      <p><strong>Protein:</strong> {result.macros.protein.toFixed(0)} g</p>
      <p><strong>Carbs:</strong> {result.macros.carbs.toFixed(0)} g</p>
      <p><strong>Fat:</strong> {result.macros.fat.toFixed(0)} g</p>
    </div>
  );

## üìä Example Output

For a 25-year-old male, 170 lbs, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, moderate activity, and goal = lose 1 lb per week:
```
{
  "bmr": 1800,
  "maintenance": 2790,
  "adjustedCalories": 2290,
  "macros": {
    "calories": 2290,
    "protein": 229,
    "carbs": 229,
    "fat": 51
  }
}
```

## üßæ Input Parameters
```
{
  weight_lbs: 170,     // body weight in pounds
  ageYears: 25,        // age in years
  heightInches: 70,    // height in inches (5'10")
  goals: -1,           // weekly goal: lose 1 lb (-1), maintain (0), gain 1 lb (+1)
  activityLevel: "moderate" // sedentary, light, moderate, active, very_active
}
```
gender: "male" | "female"
What it is: Biological sex, used in the Mifflin-St Jeor formula.


Why it matters: Men typically have higher muscle mass, which raises BMR.


Effect: Choosing "male" usually results in a higher BMR than "female" for the same weight, height, and age.



weight_lbs: number
What it is: Body weight in pounds.


Why it matters: Heavier individuals burn more energy at rest.


Effect: Each extra pound slightly increases calorie needs.


Example: At 170 lbs and 5‚Äô10‚Äù, BMR ‚âà 1800 kcal. At 200 lbs, BMR ‚âà 2000 kcal.



ageYears: number
What it is: Age in years.


Why it matters: BMR decreases with age due to muscle loss and slower metabolism.


Effect: Older individuals generally need fewer calories.



heightInches: number
What it is: Height in inches (70 in = 5‚Äô10‚Äù).


Why it matters: Taller people usually have higher BMR since they have more body mass.


Effect: Each additional inch raises daily calorie needs slightly.



goals: number
What it is: Weekly goal for weight change in pounds per week.


-1 ‚Üí lose 1 lb per week


0 ‚Üí maintain weight


+1 ‚Üí gain 1 lb per week


Why it matters: 1 pound ‚âà 3500 kcal.


Effect: Adjusts calories by (goals √ó 3500) √∑ 7 ‚Üí about ¬±500 kcal/day per lb.



activityLevel: "sedentary" | "light" | "moderate" | "active" | "very_active"
What it is: Lifestyle multiplier that adjusts BMR to estimate TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure).


Why it matters: Physical activity drastically changes daily calorie needs.

| **Light**       | 1.375      | Light exercise 1‚Äì3 days/week (walking, casual activity, easy workouts).                                |
| **Moderate**    | 1.55       | Moderate exercise 3‚Äì5 days/week (gym, sports, cycling, active job).                                    |
| **Active**      | 1.725      | Hard exercise 6‚Äì7 days/week or a very physical job (construction, athletes-in-training).               |
| **Very Active** | 1.9        | Intense exercise/training twice daily, or a physically demanding lifestyle (elite athletes, military). |
